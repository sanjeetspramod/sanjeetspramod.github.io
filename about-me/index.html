         <p>Greetings. I am a seventh-grade student at Our Lady of Mercy, residing in Burnaby with my dad, mom and older sister. I possess a strong passion for Science, Geography, Tennis, and Guitar. My older sister is a nineth grade student and I like playing tennis with her. Through this website, I aim to share my notable achievements and cherished memories from my life.</p>

     <h3>My Kumon Awards </h3>
     <p>I have pursued Kumon for over five years, achieving Gold status in both Math and Reading. Kumon has instilled in me a sense of determination; since, even when I lack motivation, I persevere to reach my goals. I look forward to continuing my journey with Kumon.</p>

   <div class="box bg-primary">
    <h3>Guitar</h3>
    <p> I have been playing the acoustic guitar for about 5 years now and am good at the instrument. Guitar has taught me discipline and hard work because of the practice that needs to be put in. I look forward to continuing my journey with guitar.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="box bg-light">
    <h3>Astronomy</h3>
    <p>Another one of my interests is astronomy. The reason I delight in it is because it gives me a glimpse of what is past the Earth. I enjoy taking photos of the stars when it is a clear sky, while also trying to name the constellations and stars.    </p>

      <p>One of my interests is the Rubik’s Cube, a puzzle that fascinates me due to its strategic nature. Solving it requires careful planning; you must consider the effects of each turn on the next moves. I find the speed challenge almost addicting and often time myself, with my personal record being under one minute! Additionally, music is another passion of mine, and I frequently use the GarageBand app to produce original melodies. From my knowledge of playing the guitar, I create music that reflects my style and sounds fantastic.</p>
      <p>Acoustic guitar is the instrument I play, and it brings me incredible joy; it’s one of my greatest talents. When I’m feeling unhappy or need a break, I turn to my guitar for help. It offers peace and lets me lose myself in music. I enjoy composing my own tunes and writing songs, allowing my emotions to flow through melodies. I’ve passed Level 1 with a high score of 94%, and I’m now focused on passing Level 3. While I appreciate other instruments, I love guitar the most, my favorite above all.</p>
      <p>Below are the results for my RCM Level 1 guitar. I have been playing the acoustic guitar for about 5 years now and am good at the instrument. Guitar has taught me discipline and hard work because of the practice that needs to be put in. I look forward to continuing my journey with guitar.     </p>
